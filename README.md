# TO DO
Here's a general list of what needs to be accomplished in the coming days:
  - [X] CATME survery (due 11/8)
  - [X] PCB design (due 11/11)
  - [X] Tweak PCD design
  - [ ] Research accelerometer 
    - [X]Pinout
    - [X]Power requirements
    - [ ]Data transimission
    - [ ]How it will be incorporated into code
  - [X] Create design for fan guard
  - [ ] Create design for holding LCD and Rotary Encoder
    - 3D print?
    - Material?
    - Dimensions?
    - Where will it be mounted?
  - [X] Create design for backdrop (angle and height)
    - Material?
    - How to accurately map out measurements?
    - Will it be attached to the project?
  - [X] Create fully functioning code prototype for UI
    - [ ] Have peripheral go to corresponding port
    - [X] Ensure LCD can properly be navigated with rotary encoder
    - [X] Ensure values can be changed ONLY within their limits
  - [ ] Get rid of the warnings from code to date
  - [ ] **CREATE TEST PLAN**
    - We might need to plan out a day for this one, it will take a while
    - Do we need code tests?

This is just a rough draft I thought up, please feel free to add anything I forgot.
