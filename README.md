# TO DO
Here's a general list of what needs to be accomplished in the coming days:
  -CATME survery (due 11/5)
  -PCB design (due 11/11)
  -Research accelerometer
    -Pinout
    -Power requirements
    -Data transimission
    -How it will be incorporated into code
  -Create design for holding LCD and Rotary Encoder
    -3D print?
    -Material?
    -Dimensions?
    -Where will it be mounted?
  -Create design for backdrop (angle and height)
    -Material?
    -How to accurately map out measurements?
    -Will it be attached to the project?
  -Create fully functioning code prototype for UI
    -Have peripheral go to corresponding port
    -Ensure LCD can properly be navigated with rotary encoder
    -Ensure values can be changed ONLY within their limits
  - ** CREATE TEST PLAN **
    -We might need to plan out a day for this one, it will take a while
    -Do we need code tests?

This is just a rough draft I thought up, please feel free to add anything I forgot.
